# Project 2 - Fancy Foods
## Intro
This was my second project at revature, a group project to build a Shopping web application. My team was four people including myself, and we had roughly a 
week to build a MVP using ASP.Net MVC. 

The goals for this project were-
- Demonstrate an ability to code and work well within a group
- Learn and show competency in ASP.Net MVC, EF, Identity, SQLServer, C#, Azure DevOps, WebAPI, Bootstrap, HTML, JS, CSS
- Considering industry standards, We incorporated Git and DevOps/Agile/Scrum methodologies/practices by using Azure DevOps Boards and Repos
- Present an MVP which satisfies the minimum requirements
We successfully accomplished all of these goals by using Azure DevOps boards to coordinate and Azure Repos to host our code and manage version control. 

## My Contributions

- Coded the global stylesheet and styled all of the partial views with CSS and Bootstrap.
- Coded the backend using ASP.Net's WebAPI, Entity Framework, and Identity Framework in C#
- Built the database schema and populated it using SQL, SSMS, and SQL Server hosted on Azure
- Built the Products Model, View, and Controller to dynamically render product cards from the database
- Worked with Javascript to make the page interactive and dynamically respond during the shopping experience
- Built the Cart functionality using Javascript and a Bootstrap modal
- Developed the Checkout MVC and stored the orders placed in the database.
- Contributed to the creation and styling of the Home, About Us, Privacy, Login, and Register pages.
- Deployed the application to Azure Cloud and configured Azure KeyVault to hold our API Key and Database connection string.
